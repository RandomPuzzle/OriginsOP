# OriginsOP
Just a place to back it up.

This datapack was originally (and mostly is) a place to give buffs to the slightly underpowered origins and removes them from the select screen. It uses the namespace `additional` as an ID.

If you want to keep them, change the value `unchooseable` in the files in `origins > origins` to false.
